## Course notes from my studies at UCPH
Each folder contains my write-up of the curriculum for a course i've been following during my BA studies at UCPH. I write them as a part of studying for exams, so you shouldn't trust the content to cover more than the most central topics. Of course I cannot guarantee the correctness of the content either, so if you catch a mistake, please tell me about it.
